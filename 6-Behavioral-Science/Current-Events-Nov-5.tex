		}
	\end{center}
	\par Citizens from Portland, Maine had many big decisions to vote on during Super Tuesday, one of which was the use of facial recognition by law enforcement. They passed the ballot initiative, which banned it as well as giving citizens the ability to sue the city for illegal surveillance if they violate it. This was following a trend of other cities, such as San Francisco; Oakland; Boston and Cambridge; and Massachusetts, and is likely to be followed by more.
